================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The calculation of midIndex may overflow if the array is very large and the values of lo, hi, arr[lo], and arr[hi] are sufficiently far apart. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Use Go's math package to perform the calculation safely, e.g., midIndex := lo + int(math.Floor(float64(query-arr[lo])*float64(hi-lo)/float64(arr[hi]-arr[lo])))

Vulnerability: CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
Issue: If the calculated midIndex is out of bounds of the arr slice, accessing arr[midIndex] will cause a runtime panic. This could be triggered by malicious input.
Solution: Add bounds checks before accessing arr[midIndex], ensuring that midIndex is within the valid range of slice indices.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The division operation in the midIndex calculation may lose precision due to truncation if performed with integer types. This could lead to incorrect results.
Solution: Perform the division using floating-point types and then convert the final result back to an integer, as shown in the solution for CWE-190.

================================================================================
Here are some test scenarios for the provided `interpolationSearch` function:

Scenario 1: Search for an existing element in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly finds the index of an element that exists in the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and choose a query element that exists in the array.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify that the returned index matches the expected index of the query element in the array.
Validation:
  The assertion should compare the returned index with the known index of the query element in the array.
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly locates an existing element in the array using the interpolation search algorithm.

Scenario 2: Search for a non-existing element in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function returns -1 when searching for an element that does not exist in the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and choose a query element that does not exist in the array.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns -1, indicating that the element was not found.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned value is -1.
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the searched element is not present in the array.

Scenario 3: Search in an empty array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function returns -1 when searching in an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty array of integers.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the empty array and any query element.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns -1, indicating that the element was not found.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned value is -1.
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles the case of searching in an empty array correctly.

Scenario 4: Search for the first element in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly finds the index of the first element in the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and choose the first element as the query element.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 0, indicating that the first element was found at index 0.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned value is 0.
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles searching for the first element in the array.

Scenario 5: Search for the last element in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly finds the index of the last element in the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and choose the last element as the query element.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the index of the last element in the array.
Validation:
  The assertion should compare the returned index with the known index of the last element in the array.
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles searching for the last element in the array.

Scenario 6: Search for an element smaller than the smallest element in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function returns -1 when searching for an element smaller than the smallest element in the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and choose a query element smaller than the smallest element in the array.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns -1, indicating that the element was not found.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned value is -1.
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the searched element is smaller than the smallest element in the array.

Scenario 7: Search for an element larger than the largest element in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function returns -1 when searching for an element larger than the largest element in the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and choose a query element larger than the largest element in the array.
  Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns -1, indicating that the element was not found.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the returned value is -1.
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the searched element is larger than the largest element in the array.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `interpolationSearch` function, including normal operation, edge cases, and error handling. They ensure that the function behaves correctly in different scenarios and returns the expected results.

// Comment: The error indicates that the Go module is not initialized properly.
// To resolve this, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:
// go mod init <module-name>
