================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-284: Improper Access Control
Issue: The code directly accepts keyboard input and controls the drone without any access control or authentication. This could allow unauthorized users to control the drone if they have access to the machine running the code.
Solution: Implement proper access controls to authenticate and authorize users before allowing them to control the drone. This could involve requiring a password, API key, or other credentials.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The keyboard input is not validated or sanitized before being used to control the drone. Malicious input could potentially cause unintended drone behavior or crash the program.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the keyboard input to ensure it only contains expected key values before using it to control the drone. Reject or escape any invalid or unexpected input.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The handleKeyboardInput function exposes direct control of the drone to the user without any limits or safety checks. A user could accidentally or maliciously cause the drone to perform unsafe actions.
Solution: Refactor the handleKeyboardInput function to limit the drone actions that can be triggered by user input. Implement safety checks and maximum limits on distance, speed, altitude, etc.
