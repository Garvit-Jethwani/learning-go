Scenario 1: Task ID Exists and Status is Changed Successfully

  Details:
    Description: This test will check if the function is able to change a task's status when the task's ID exists in the database.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mocked database with some tasks having different IDs. Create a mock of the 'UpdateOne' function too. The task which ID will be passed to 'undoTask' function should initially have 'status': true in the database.
    Act: Call the 'undoTask' function with an ID of a task which exists in the mock database and has 'status': true.
    Assert: Verify if the 'UpdateOne' function has been called with the correct parameters and if the status of the task in the database has been changed to false.

  Validation:
    Though the function doesn't return any response, its success is determined by its ability to update the status of a given task to false in the database. So, checking if 'UpdateOne' is called with the correct parameters and subsequently verifying the task's status in the database is a good way to assert the function's successful execution. This feature helps implement 'undo' feature of managing tasks.

Scenario 2: Task ID Doesn't Exist

  Details:
    Description: This test will check the function's behavior when a non-existent task ID is passed as input.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mocked empty database and a mock of the 'UpdateOne' function.
    Act: Call the 'undoTask' function with an ID which doesn't exist in the mock database.
    Assert: Verify that the 'UpdateOne' function has not been called and log.Fatal throws an error.

  Validation:
    The function is supposed to only process valid task IDs found in the database. Therefore, an error is expected if a non-existent ID is used. This will help in maintaining the integrity of the data and prevent accidental or wrong undo operations on non-existing tasks.

Scenario 3: Task ID is Invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test will check the function's behavior when an invalid task ID is passed as input.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock of the 'UpdateOne' function.
    Act: Call the 'undoTask' function with an invalid ID format.
    Assert: Verify that the 'ObjectIDFromHex' function throws an error and log.Fatal logs the error accordingly.

  Validation:
    This test is necessary to ensure that the function handles inputs correctly and throws errors when an ID format is wrong. This protects against potential bugs and errors that could occur due to malformed inputs.
